> Built an customer query application using JFrame and Swing in java which :

1. Allows user to login into his account by inputting correct
username and password (which can be found below in instructions).

2. Allows user to fill query form and enter his/her e-mail address to get an reply e-mail from the email account the user wants about the query. 

   PS: To get the reply email, user needs to provide the
   login credentials of the sender email account in the program

> Intructions to use Application

1. Username is "orange" and Password is "apple" which can be changed using lines 124 and 125 in LoginPage.java file.

2. Sender e-mail needs to be input by the user of this Application using line 195.
   Also sender e-mail address and password needs to be input by the user using lines 169 and 170 in QueryForm.java file.
